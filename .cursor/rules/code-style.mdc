# Code Style Guide

This document outlines the naming conventions for files and folders within our project. It's designed to ensure consistency and readability for development, especially when interacting with AI coding models.

## Folder Naming

    Convention: All folders should use kebab-case notation.

        Example: correct-folder-name

## File Naming

    General Files: Files should follow the same kebab-case notation as folders.

        Examples: react-component.tsx, typescript-file.ts

    Specific File Types:

        React Page Components: These files should be named with a .page suffix.

            Example: react-component.page.tsx

        Constants Files: Files containing constants should use a .constants suffix.

            Example: ts-file.constants.ts

        Type Definition Files: Files defining types should include a .type suffix.

            Example: ts-file.type.ts

    Hooks:

        Naming Convention: Hook files must begin with the use keyword and follow kebab-case.

            Examples: use-some-hook.ts, use-other-hook.ts

## Code

    Hooks:

        Functions: All hooks should use default function style with function keyword, not arrow function. But if it need, arrow function also can use.

            Examples: export function useSomeHook() {...}
